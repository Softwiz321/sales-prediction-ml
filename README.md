# Sales Prediction using Machine Learning and EDA
End-to-end data science project for predicting sales using exploratory data analysis and machine learning regression models.

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales based on historical sales data and associated features. The notebook performs **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key sales drivers and applies **machine learning regression models** to build a predictive system.
---

## Objective
- Analyze historical sales patterns and trends
- Perform EDA to understand the relationship between features and sales
- Build regression models to predict future sales
- Evaluate and compare model performance using standard metrics

---

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset Type:** Sales / advertising dataset  
- **Features may include:**
  - Advertising spend (TV, Radio, Newspaper) or similar
  - Other numerical predictors (depending on dataset)
- **Target Variable:** Sales

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Inspection
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Reviewed structure, data types, and summary statistics
- Checked for missing values

---

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values (if any)
- Selected relevant features for modeling
- Split data into training and testing sets

---

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized sales distribution
- Analyzed relationship between sales and key predictors
- Used correlation heatmap to identify influential features
- Plotted trends and feature-wise comparisons

---

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Selected predictors based on correlation and domain relevance
- Scaled features if required for model performance

---

### 5. Model Development
Trained and evaluated regression models such as:
- Linear Regression
- (Optional, if present in your notebook) Random Forest Regressor

---

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Metrics used:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Visualized Actual vs Predicted sales values
- Interpreted residual patterns

---

## Key Results
- Identified key features influencing sales
- Linear Regression provided a strong baseline model
- ML models captured relationships between advertising spend and sales
- Visualization helped interpret prediction accuracy and errors
